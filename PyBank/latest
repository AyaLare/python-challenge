#  This python will create the PyBank Script which will print:
# 1. The total number of months included in the dataset
# 2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
# 3. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
# 4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
# 5. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
